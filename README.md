# NotAnotherBasePlanner

This is a planning application designed to help users manage supply chains in the space economics sim Prosperous
Universe. Development is ongoing, and at some point I'll get a roadmap posted here. Access the latest published
version [here](https://notanotherbaseplanner.azurewebsites.net)

## Current Features

1. Market Maker Search: Allows for searching for market makers by Expertise or Material Ticker
2. Supply Chains: Search for a material to generate a nested list of all inputs and their recipes, all the way down to
   basic resources.
